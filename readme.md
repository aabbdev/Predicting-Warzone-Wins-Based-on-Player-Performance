In this project, I will be exploring what factors lead to more wins on COD Warzone - specifically the Battle Royale mode which is one of the most popular games being played.

I would like to create a model that can predict the probability a person can win games based on their skill, playstyle and stats. Then, I could make recommendations on how to improve to increase the likelihood of winning Warzone matches.

I will be collecting player stats from various COD stat tracking websites through means of a scraper.
